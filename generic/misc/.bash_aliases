# miscellaneous aliases
alias findcdump="find ~/ -name core -type f" # finds program crash data files named 'core'; these are extremely large (often upwards of 1GB) files produced by a core dump, and they can clog up the file system very quickly if left unmanaged
alias getaliases="source ~/.bash_aliases"  # refreshes your bash session with any new aliases you add to this file, avoiding the need to open a new console
